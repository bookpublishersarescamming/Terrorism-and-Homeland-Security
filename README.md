The updated edition of the textbook that offers student-friendly coverage of the major topics in terrorism studies by one of the leading scholars in the field.


The years since 9/11 have witnessed a rapid rise in terrorism-related courses, programs, research centers, journals, and books. The second edition of Terrorism and Homeland Security gathers these intellectual insights and developments into a comprehensive, interdisciplinary introduction to the topic of terrorism.

This text:

• Examines various approaches to defining terrorism, including psychological, criminological, and structural definitions.
• Discusses the financing of terrorist operations, and weaponry, as well as common tactics and strategies, including cyberterrorism.
• Covers the historical foundations of modern terrorism and various types of terrorism, including ethno-national, revolutionary, religious, and state terrorism.
• Explores terrorism in the United States—of both domestic and international origin—the relationship between the media and terrorism, and the institutions involved in homeland security.

This new edition has been thoroughly updated to reflect the latest events (including those of January 6, 2021) and scholarship in the field. In particular, Chapter 12 contains perspective on the current state of various American policies protecting the homeland since the elections of Presidents Donald Trump and Joe Biden.

Accessibly written and full of helpful in-text pedagogical features to enhance student learning, this is an excellent primary or supplementary textbook for courses in terrorism, counterterrorism, and homeland security.
